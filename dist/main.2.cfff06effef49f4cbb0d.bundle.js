There is a lot of momentum being put into making artificial waves become viable for business and surfers but it also leaves people wander what makes surfing, surfing.\n\nI&#x27;ll take you through the wave I grew up surfing and how everyone is trying to recreate it in an attempt to commodify the ocean wave."},{note:"* 1963 bruce brown - endless summer.\n* 1964 jbay is ridden for the first.\n* Surf is temperamental\n\nIn 1963, bruce brown made the famous surf documentary looking for the perfect wave, and decide it was in St Francis, he said it broke 300 days of the year even though he was only their for a couple days. Jbay was first ridden in 1964 and everyone realized brown had missed the real perfect wave by about 20km. - shows you how temperamental weather + surf can be."},{note:"So I grew up surfing JBay, which is a righthand point break.

This is different from say a beach break where sand bars consistently change and therefore change the way the wave breaks. Jbay is pretty consistent breaks the same as long as the tide and swell direction is the same. (The other type of break is a reef break) It just means the wave hits the reef at once rather than wrapping around a point it generally just pitches and throws as a pose to peeling."},{note:"* One way is if you have the most of the ingredients - for instance swell + wind direction but you had a inconsistent of disruptive bathomtry. \n\n* Then you could create a artificial reef to help sculpt the wave.\n\n* But for projects like that you need local goverment that is will to take a risk on unproven technology."},{note:"* cost 3mill pounds (2.5% of councils annual budget)\n* Supposed to double the annual surfing days and increase wave size by 30%.  \n* Geotextile sandbags.\n* Company went under before they could get their money."},{note:"There have been other efforts in India and the states but no success stories I think in most cases you need a lot more money than you think and that the real big win lies in consistent swell than the reef shape."},{},{note:"The first one was made in Munich Germany in 1914, people seemed to like it but it was a machine that displaced water (in the cage) pumping back and forth. So it was more like chop that waves and wasn&#x27;t at all ridable.\n\nThere have been alot of wave pools in the years since but only the last few years have they started to make waves worth talking about.\n\nThere are currently ~3 strategies to making wave pool waves."},{note:"Underwater plow, much like a train engine that pushes a submerged airplane wing which forces water against a contoured bottom until it curls into a perfect 45 second barrel of a wave.\n\nBy making changes to the Hydrofoil they are able to create 50 different types of waves (whatever that means)"},{},{},{note:"Waco texas.\n\n\nI couldn&#x27;t find much about this one but it&#x27;s looking pretty good. They brag how their waves don&#x27;t try make the perfect wave but rather imitate surf by having dynamic conditions that vary like the ocean. PerfectSwellÂ®\n\nProprietary PerfectSwellÂ® Reflecting Wave Generator creates waves with particle motion like the ocean. The PerfectSwellÂ® Phased Array Control System controls air pressure firing patterns and sequences to create unlimited wave types. We have also developed a touch screen interface allowing the operator to effectively design their own wave. Infinite OceanÂ® is a brand new innovative approach to pool design creating an authentic and realistic beach."},{note:"This one is pretty easy to understand they have a massive plunger and drop it down into the water raising it up with compressed air.\n\nThey&#x27;ll have 5 different breaks around the plunger for different levels, and plan to color code the breaks like ski resorts code their slopes.\n\nYou need a bigger lake for this but because its a single source I think it&#x27;ll be easier churn out more waves per minute. They say:\n\nWaves per hour, allowing up to 240 surfers in the lake at the same time, all catching 10 waves per hour."},{},{note:"All of these technologies are still pretty immature, I watched a demo of the surf lakes one and they broke the plunger when they tried to make it bigger than 4ft. \n\nKelly&#x27;s wave (with the hydrafoils is now a stop on the pro-surfing contest tournament) but is not open to the public I assume because of the high operating cost and the time between waves.\n\nThe PerfectSwell tech is actually open to the public in texas and is where the usa team is preparing for the olympics, all of these technologies tried to bid to be used in the 2020 olympics. \n\nwhere kelly slater actually built a wave pool (nearing completion) but tokyo endup choosing the ocean for their contest and it looks like paris olympics 2024 will do the same.
